A jury sentenced former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, who was convicted of murdering her neighbor, Bothem Shem Jean in his own home to ten years in prison.
A crowd outside of the courtroom started screaming even before the sentencing was read.

Judge Tammy Kemp asked bailiffs to tell them to cut that out.

On Tuesday a jury of eight women and four men found Guyger guilty of murdering Jean, 26.

The court heard more evidence during the sentencing phase, including racially insensitive text messages Guyger shared with other officers including her former partner and extramarital lover Sgt. Martin Rivera.
